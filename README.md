# Predict Customer Churn

- Project **Predict Customer Churn** of ML DevOps Engineer Nanodegree Udacity

## Project Description
The main goal of this project is to train a ML model to predict customer churn.
This includes the data processing, EDA, data engineering, training and testing
of the model and visualization of the results.


## Running Files
The churn_library.py file contains all the functions necessary to the execution
of the project. Running "python ./churn_library.py" will execute the file and 
generate the models and images for the bank_data dataset. The images are saved
in the images folder and the pickle of the models on the models folder.

The churn_script_logging_and_tests_solution.py contains tests for the functions
on the churn_library.py file. Running "python ./churn_script_logging_and_tests_solution.py"
will execute the tests and save the corresponding log in the churn_library.log
file on the logs folder. 

The constants.py contains all the constants used in the two other .py files.

The requirements.txt contains the dependecies of the project.
